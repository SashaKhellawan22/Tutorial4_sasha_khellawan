#The purpose of the repository:
#The purpose of creating this repository was to start navigating the GitHub platform and learn how to collaborate with team members. I also learned how to make projects, leave comments, review team members work and how to push a branch to main. These will all be key factors to success once westart coding in a collaborative environment. 

#The steps you followed to complete the tutorial
#To complete this tutorial, I followed the steps provided on Moodle. I also consulted various tutorials on the internet to understand how to add a collaborator, how to perform a pull request, how to approve a request and how to make a branch. The instructions on Moodle for the tutorial 4 assignment were very straight forward once I experimented with GitHub. 

#The names of both collaborators involved:
#Laura Dias and Sasha Khellawan
